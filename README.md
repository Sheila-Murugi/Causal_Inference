# Causal_Inference
This repository covers a project that deals with logistic optimization where delivery drivers' location is optimized using causal inferencing. It works on company data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders.
